        My name is Heather and I am a web developer in Atlanta.

        <p>
        I am a pharmacist with several years of experience in different areas of patient healthcare, medical claims auditing, healthcare compliance, fraud control and prevention, and public health policy. I am completing a MERN full-stack bootcamp and I plan to use the web development skills that I have learned to transition to a more technology-focused career.
        </p>
        <p>
        I have always enjoyed creative writing, learning new technology, and traveling. I am completing my certification as a MERN full-stack web developer at Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Georgia and I am excited to apply the things that I have learned to teach other people that might be interested in changing careers or adding new skills to their current roles.
